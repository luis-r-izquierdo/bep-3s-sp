Mathematica notebook created to analyze Best Experienced Payoff (BEP) dynamics in 3 strategy games with several players.

This software was used to create several figures in the paper titled ["Strategy sets closed under payoff sampling"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geb.2022.12.006), published in 2023 in <i>Games and Economic Behavior</i> by [Segismundo S. Izquierdo](http://www.segis.izqui.org) & [Luis R. Izquierdo](http://www.luis.izqui.org). [doi: 10.1016/j.geb.2022.12.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geb.2022.12.006).

This work is dedicated to the memory of our dear master and friend Bill Sandholm.
