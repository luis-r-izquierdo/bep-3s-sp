Mathematica notebook created to analyze Best Experienced Payoff (BEP) dynamics in 3 strategy games with several players

This software was used to create several figures in the paper titled "Strategy sets closed under payoff sampling", by [Segismundo S. Izquierdo](http://www.segis.izqui.org) & [Luis R. Izquierdo](http://www.luis.izqui.org).

This work is dedicated to the memory of our dear master and friend Bill Sandholm.
